# Kanban Board Application



## Description

The Kanban Board Application is a task management tool designed for agile teams, featuring a secure login system powered by JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users can manage tasks across various stages such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" with drag-and-drop functionality, ensuring a smooth workflow. Authentication is required to manage tasks, with JWTs used for session management and authorization.

## Features
1.User Authentication: Secure login with JWT, stored in localStorage for session management.
2.Task Management: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
3.Persistent Session: JWT is used for all API requests and stored in local storage for subsequent requests.
4..Session Timeout: Session automatically expires after a period of inactivity.
5.Logout: Users can log out, and the JWT is removed from local storage.

  ## how it works
How It Works
Login and Authentication:

When users visit the application, they are greeted with a login page where they must enter their credentials (email and password).
Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated by the server and returned to the client, where it's stored in localStorage.
The JWT token is attached to every subsequent API request to authenticate and authorize users.
Main Kanban Board:

After logging in, users are directed to the main Kanban Board, which displays tasks organized into three columns:
To Do: Tasks that are yet to be started.
In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
Done: Tasks that have been completed.
Tasks can be created, edited, or deleted directly within these columns.
Task Creation:

Users can add new tasks by filling out a form that collects the task's title, description, and priority level.
Upon submission, the task is created and displayed in the To Do column.
Task Movement (Drag-and-Drop):

Users can move tasks between columns (e.g., from To Do to In Progress) using drag-and-drop functionality, allowing for easy task management.
The system updates the task's status on the server to reflect the column in which it was placed.
Session Management:

JWT is stored in localStorage, ensuring users remain logged in across page reloads.
The session automatically expires after a specified period of inactivity (configurable in the backend). When expired, users are logged out and redirected to the login page.
Logout:

Users can click the Logout button at any time, which clears the JWT from localStorage and returns them to the login page.



  
##Installation 

To get the application running locally:-
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/lekshmisree89/challenge-14

Navigate to the project directory:cd challenge-14

Install dependencies for both client and server:cd server
npm install

Create a .env file: Inside the server directory:
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_db_url
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Run the application (npm run start:dev)
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

##Usage
Login: Enter your credentials (email and password) on the login page.
Task Management:
Create new tasks by filling out the task form.
Drag and drop tasks between the To Do, In Progress, and Done columns.
Edit or delete tasks as needed.
Logout: Click the Logout button to log out and clear your JWT from localStorage.
Session Timeout: If you stay inactive, the session will automatically expire, and you will be logged out

## Technologies
Frontend: React, TypeScript
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Database: PostgreSQL ,sequelize
Deployment: Render

 ### Deployment
The app is deployed to Render. 
Create a GitHub repository for your server and client.
Deploy the server:
Create a new Web Service in Render for your server, setting up the necessary environment variables (database credentials and JWT secret).
Deploy the client:
Create a Static Site in Render for your frontend and configure environment variables as needed.
